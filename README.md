WEEKEND REACT GALLERY - Images from a dog's life!
## Description

This project was an introduction to some of the base features of ReactJs and the practice of refactoring by way of making an app that was a simple interactive photo gallery.

I started the project by picking out six images of my dog and converting them into jpegs of more manageable size. I next plotted out the functionality required for my app and began figuring out how to manipulate that across a main app file and two components. This process involved refactoring which was very new to me and as such proved to be very tedious. After constructing and testing my GET routes, I succeeded refactoring into to the first component, and then the next after much time and effort; making sure that my images were still rendering to the page before and after each refactor. Moved onto to making the imgClick function next that flip/toggle my picture to a description and back by clicking on it. This took some reading up on conditional rendering and it proved helpful. I constructed my 'Like' button quickly thereafter, and all that was left to make was the PUT route that would render my likes to the DOM.

Although I was able to test the PUT route successfully in Postman, I was not able to get the "Likes" button to update to the DOM. I also wasn't able to get my styling done to my satisfaction, but I will revisit this.
