PLAN FOR WEEKEND CHALLEGENE #4 - REACT GALLERY
- Gonna make it about LOUIE!!!

Check instructions carefully and repeatedly!

Make sure all dependencies are installed and hooked in where they need to be {x}
    
    - 'npm install nodemon --global' {x}
    - 'npm uninstall axios' then 'npm install axios' if it is not the latest version {x}
    - 'npm run server'.... on your left!
    - 'npm run client'.... on your right!
    - check 'start' or whatever that issue that sometime creeps up in package.json. {x}

Test premade GET and PUT routes in Postman (DO NOT MODIFY gallery.router.js!) {}
    
    - Double check to make sure, but POST and DELETE don't appear to be 
    necessary for base mode {x}

NO DATABASE (or pool)! - Think of some images you would like to use for this project! {}
    
    - Images should be stored in images file in public {x}
    - Data for images is stored as {id:,path:,description:,likes:} in gallery.data.js {} -> exports galleryItems -> to gallery.router.js -> should go to GalleryItem.jsx via GET from router to client App.jsx {x}
    
COMPONENTS - make folders and files {}
    
    - 'GalleryList' -> GalleryList.jsx should take the data from gallery.data.js, loop over it and convert into individual GalleryItem(s) {}
    - 'GalleryItem' -> 'GalleryItem.jsx' should take in an individual GalleryItem. GalleryList.jsx should use the GalleryItem.jsx component to display an image. {}
    - Read up on conditional rendering before doing anymore {}
    - PUT:
